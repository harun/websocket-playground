# websocket-playground

## Getting Started

Check out the repository and run

```shell
npm install && bower install
```

Start the server via

```shell
node server.js
```

Open the `index.html` file in the browser. It should connect to the server via websockets and display random data points via d3.js as red circles.

When you enter a numeric value in the input field at the top, it is also rendered with d3.js and displayed in blue.
